This page hosts little ideas, solutions to problems I've faced in the past or mistakes that I don't
want to repeat again - stored here as a reference in case they bother me again. Read on, maybe even
you might find something relevant!

# Some useful aliases

- Timesync!

```console
$ alias timesync='sudo /etc/cron.daily/timesync'
```

```bash
# /etc/cron.daily/timesync
sudo date -s "$(wget -qSO- --max-redirect=0 google.com \
              2>&1 | grep Date: | cut -d' ' -f5-8)Z"
```

- Short for activating virtual environments

```console
$ alias sv='source venv/bin/activate; export PS1="(${PWD##*/}-venv)$_OLD_VIRTUAL_PS1"'
```

- I use these all the time

```console
$ alias log='tail -f /var/log/syslog'
$ alias nmr='sudo service network-manager restart; sudo service networking restart; log'
```

- Show folder sizes in descending order

```console
$ alias duinfo='sudo du --all --block-size=MB --max-depth=1 | sort -n'
```

- I always forget the color scheme of my terminal. It's `base16_isotope`. Oh!

# Docker and DC++

Docker and DC++ don't go hand in hand. Docker creates `iptables` routes for private ip addresses
like 172.17.x.x and DC++ uses the same. You may keep on getting _No route to host_ when you try to
connect to a hub, which is really annoying! [@kamermans](https://github.com/kamermans) has a gist
[here](https://gist.github.com/kamermans/94b1c41086de0204750b) that helped me out.

# Test outgoing ports

At times you may be behind a restricted network. Here is a
[bash script](http://superuser.com/a/815481/537144) to check all outgoing ports that aren't blocked
by your firewall.

I tested the open ports (upto 4000) in my university and here is the list as of October 2016:

```text
22   SSH
53   DNS
80   C'mon!
143  IMAP
443  HTTPS
465  SMTP
993  IMAPS
2082 cPanel. Strange!
```

# Use Google Fonts offline

Sounds simple, but no easy way to do it. I found this
[tool](https://google-webfonts-helper.herokuapp.com/fonts) by [@majodev](http://twitter.com/majodev)
to be really helpful.

# Installing Node

Again, there is an overload of methods used to install node and npm. Here is what works for me - the
easy way.

```console
$ sudo apt-get install nodejs npm
$ sudo npm install -g n npm
$ sudo ln -s "$(which nodejs)" /usr/bin/node
```

# Installing OpenCV

Installing OpenCV has always been a mammoth task. I seriously hate the whole process of downloading
a bulky git repository and building it from the source. And also the fact that there's no easy _pip
install opencv_ way out. But as long as you don't have any constraints like using it on an embedded
device, the folks at menpo have an easy way out using anaconda.

```console
$ conda install -c menpo opencv
$ conda install -c menpo opencv3
```

Of course, if you have specific requirements, it's better to build from source.

# Raspberry Pi

- [Peter Legierski](https://twitter.com/peterlegierski)'s
  [blog post](http://blog.self.li/post/63281257339/raspberry-pi-part-1-basic-setup-without-cables)
  helped me out with a headless start when I had no idea how to start my _pi_!
- Setting up a VNC Server was easy too, thanks to the
  [official docs](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/remote-access/vnc/README.md).
- The forums have a good
  [article](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=133691&p=1025366) in case you are
  interested to install a GUI.
- Use `ssh -Y pi@raspberry` to view GUI outputs from the _pi_ to the host machine.
- In case you want to access the webcam and view images, use `fswebcam image.jpg` and
  `feh image.jpg`.
- Install OpenCV for raspberry with this
  [gist](https://gist.github.com/willprice/c216fcbeba8d14ad1138). This can make your day indeed!

# Configure Mutt with Gmail

[Nick's post](http://nickdesaulniers.github.io/blog/2016/06/18/mutt-gmail-ubuntu/) describes how to
use your own gmail account in case you want to set up something like automated email alerts or
regular database backups.

# Remove Python Package with Dependencies

Thanks to [Tomasz Gągor](https://gagor.pl/). You can find his script

# Academic writing with Pandoc

Mort Yao's [post](https://www.soimort.org/notes/161117/) at [soimort.org](https://www.soimort.org)
is a useful resource on using Pandoc for academic writing.

# PuDB Custom Stringifier
